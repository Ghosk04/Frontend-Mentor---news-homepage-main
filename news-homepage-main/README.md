## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript to create the sidebar of the mobile menu

### What I learned

This website was very challenging for menn, and give me the opportunity to increase my skills in responsive and design.
It's was really hard for me to design the side bar and the make the responsive of the website, but by hardworking, i pass though it. I am 
very thankful for this challenge.

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills in responsive, and i really want to learn how to animate my websites because they feel to dull and static for me.
